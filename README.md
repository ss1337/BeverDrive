Media application for BMWs

In order to use it you need:
* a BMW with Ibus (e38, e39, e46 for example)
* a car PC
* a serial Ibus-interface, I use Reslers interface you can find here: http://www.reslers.de/IBUS/ 
* a VGA->composite adapter in order to connect the VGA output to the back camera input

Note: bluetooth support is buggy, and it needs to have the device capable of auto-pairing to the PC
